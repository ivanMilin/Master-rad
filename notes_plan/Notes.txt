This file explains briefly what each component does and if its checked via simulation waveform.

1. PC (Program counter)
   - Increases by 4 to fetch the next instruction from file code.mem, or by some offset in case of jump instruction.
   - This works via sim, jump instuction works, branch instruction works (blt specifically).

2. Im (Instruction memory)
   - Memory that holds the set of instuctions to be executed, loaded from code.mem file. Use Ripes simulator to create
     those instructions.
   - This works via sim.

3. Rf (Register file)
   - Register bank that holds 32 regs with width 32 (x0 - x31). We use these values for our operations. 
   - This is checked, but debrief how does sh and sb work, sw looks fine and understandable.

4. Ig (Immidiate generator)
   - Block that extends our immidiate, depending on the type of instruction and its format.

5. Bc (Branch controll) 
   - Jump and branch controller, regular jump and branching options (beq,bne,blt,bge,bltu,bgeu)

6. Controller 
   - Depending on a current instruction, set controll signals to required values (MUX sel siganls, enables and others..)
   - This looks good in sim, but formal is the perfect place for checking this.

7. ALU (Aritmethic logic unit) 
   - Does out arithmetic operations.
   - Looks okay in sim, also check in formal.

8. Memory (Data memory)
   - Store data here, also depending on a type of instruciton.
   - Looks okay in sim, check how exactly does store work when it comes to sb and sh and offsets that are not dividable with 4.
   - Load instruction works.

9. Processor (Top file)
   - Connects everything.

Bugs found during simulation and formal verification
1. Wrong implementation of data-memory (lw,lb,lh)
2. Wrong implementation of I - opcode in controller 
3. Wrong implementation of U - opcode in controller, wrong value of "alu_op" (found while testing LUI)
4. Wrong implementation of alu - missing state in switch-case for LUI 
5. Wrong implementation of STORE half word and STORE byte in reference model.
